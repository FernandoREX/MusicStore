# MusicStore
Project to build programs with the object-oriented paradigm, as well as the design of abstractions to support the design of reusable software and libraries, employing a systematic testing approach.

The "music store" seeks as its main objective to serve both the administrative part of the store and the entertainment part, with functional tools for each of the cases, such as a database where all the products are stored of the said shop, and a music and video playback system for different screens.

In the end, it was possible to complete the requested requirements successfully and with 100% satisfaction.
